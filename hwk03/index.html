                Weʼre amping up chicken breasts with a glaze of smoky ancho chile paste and fresh orange juice in this
                recipe. On the side, roasted carrots and lightly creamy, golden
                raisin-studded rice perfectly accent the sweetness of the glaze.

            <div class="page1_con_text">
                Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. In a
                medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 11/2 cups of
                water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to
                low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the
                heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.

                While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots;
                quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.Remove and discard the stems
                of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a
                peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2
                teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the
                orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the chile paste and 2
                tablespoons of water until smooth.

                Place the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to
                coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove

                until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to 6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip
                and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently spooning the glaze
                over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked
                through. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into the glaze until the butter
                has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
